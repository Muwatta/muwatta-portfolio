static/img/img_20241219_104415_645.jpg  My technology journey began in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic during my second year (200L) at university.

            With a goal of integrating technology into Arabic culture and education, and ensuring financial security,

            I embarked on a quest to explore diverse technological realms—from cloud computing to data science.

            <br /><br />

            However, a turning point came when I narrowly missed the AWS Practitioner exam with a score of 686,

            which redirected my path toward web development. This experience not only ignited my passion for building

            innovative digital experiences but also deepened my commitment to making technology accessible to all.

            <br /><br />

            Today, I stand as a passionate software developer, educator, and convener. I share my knowledge by teaching

            coding to students and organizing bootcamps to empower aspiring developers. Every project I undertake is a

            chapter in my story—a narrative of exploration, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of innovation.

            I believe in transforming challenges into opportunities and ideas into impactful solutions.
